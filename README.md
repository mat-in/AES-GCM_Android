# AES GCM Encryption and Decryption for Android

This project provides an implementation of AES encryption and decryption using the GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) mode of operation for secure data handling in Android applications. It allows you to securely encrypt and decrypt data either using a key stored in the Android Keystore or a manually provided key.

## Features

- **AES Encryption & Decryption**: Secure encryption using AES algorithm in GCM mode.
- **Keystore Integration**: Supports key generation and storage in the Android Keystore system.
- **Manual Key Management**: Allows using a manually provided Base64 encoded key for encryption and decryption.
- **Easy-to-use API**: Simple methods for encrypting and decrypting text data.

## Prerequisites

- Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher.
- Android Studio with the latest stable version.

## Setup

### 1. Add the necessary dependencies

Make sure to add the following dependencies in your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.2.0'
    implementation 'androidx.core:core-ktx:1.5.0'
}
````

### 2. Key Generation and Encryption

There are two ways to use this library for encryption/decryption: using the Android Keystore or using a manually generated key.

### Using Keystore for Key Management:

The AES encryption key can be generated and stored securely in the Android Keystore.

#### Key Generation:

Use the following method to generate a key and store it securely in the Keystore:

```kotlin
AesGcm.createKeystoreKey("secure_alias")
```

#### Encrypting and Decrypting Data:

Once the key is stored in the Keystore, you can easily encrypt and decrypt data using the following methods:

```kotlin
// Create an AES instance using the Keystore key
val aes = AesGcm.fromKeystore("secure_alias")

// Encrypt data
val encrypted = aes.encrypt("Secret Message")

// Decrypt data
val decrypted = aes.decrypt(encrypted)
```

### Using a Manual Key:

If you want to use a manually created AES key (encoded in Base64), you can do so with the following methods.

#### Generate a Base64 Encoded Key:

To generate a key and encode it in Base64 format:

```kotlin
val base64Key = AesGcm.generateBase64Key() // You can specify the key size (default: 256)
```

#### Encrypting and Decrypting Data:

Use the following methods to encrypt and decrypt with the manually provided key:

```kotlin
// Create an AES instance using the Base64 key
val aes = AesGcm.fromBase64Key(base64Key)

// Encrypt data
val encrypted = aes.encrypt("Secret Message")

// Decrypt data
val decrypted = aes.decrypt(encrypted)
```

## Code Explanation

### AesGcm Class:

The `AesGcm` class is the core of this implementation. It provides methods for:

* **Encryption**: The `encrypt()` method encrypts plaintext using AES in GCM mode.
* **Decryption**: The `decrypt()` method decrypts ciphertext.
* **Key Management**: Keys can be stored securely in the Android Keystore or manually provided in Base64 format.

### Companion Object Methods:

* **`fromKeystore(alias: String)`**: Initializes the AES encryption/decryption using a key stored in the Android Keystore.
* **`fromBase64Key(base64Key: String)`**: Initializes AES encryption/decryption using a manually provided Base64 key.
* **`generateBase64Key(keySize: Int)`**: Generates and returns a Base64 encoded AES key.
* **`createKeystoreKey(alias: String, keySize: Int)`**: Creates and stores a key in the Android Keystore for encryption and decryption.

### KeyWrapper Class:

The `KeyWrapper` class is used internally to differentiate between keys stored in the Keystore and manually provided keys.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a complete example of how to use this library:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    lateinit var aes: AesGcm

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        // Step 1: Create the key in the Android Keystore
        AesGcm.createKeystoreKey("secure_alias")

        // Step 2: Create an encryptor using that alias
        val aes = AesGcm.fromKeystore("secure_alias")

        // Step 3: Encrypt and decrypt data
        val encrypted = aes.encrypt("Secret Message")
        val decrypted = aes.decrypt(encrypted)

        Log.d("AES", "Encrypted: $encrypted")
        Log.d("AES", "Decrypted: $decrypted")
    }
}
```

## Testing

Test the encryption and decryption by logging the encrypted and decrypted values. Ensure that the decrypted message matches the original plaintext.

### Notes

* **Security Consideration**: Always use secure channels for sharing encrypted data, and never expose encryption keys in your app's source code or commit them to version control.
